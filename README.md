# School of Data 2019 Presentation
Presentation given at the School of Data Conference March 2, 2019


## Using Data to Improve the Laws of New York City 
### Facilitated by New York City Council's Data Team
Learn how the New York City Council’s new Data Team uses a data-driven approach to improve the New York City Council’s policy making process. 

The New York City Council Data Team answers policy questions and informs laws about everything from public housing residents’ heat, to school bus delays, and marijuana arrests. 

The Data Team also uses data to conduct oversight of City Agencies. 

We source datasets, create data analysis and models, maps, and dashboards to assist Council staff and Council Members to use data to make decisions. Our unique strength is in marrying data with public policy making. 

At School of Data, we'll talk about how the New York City Council Data Team uses data to make informed decisions and how you can too.
